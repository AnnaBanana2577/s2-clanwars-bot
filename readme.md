## Overview

This repo contains source code for a very basic Discord bot that facilitates and organizes clan wars for soldat 2.
This is an unofficial project, and not a replacement for official Soldat 2 tournaments. This project is merely a simple system to play premades 3v3's in order to practice for official Soldat 2 tournaments.

This Discord bot allows players to register for clan wars, using their playfabId. Players can then create clans, apply for clans, and join clans.
Players may use a command to signal that they are avaialble for a clan war. Once 3 players from the same clan are 'ready', that clan is marked as looking for a clan war.
Once 2 clans are marked as looking for a clan war, a clan war starts between the 2 clan wars. Each player will be sent joining info for the server, and the match will start.

For now, clan wars will not be tracked or scored. This system is meant to be very basic and provide an enviroment to play structured premade 3v3's. If enough players use the system and desire stats and rankings, provided no official system exists or is being worked on, then I may entertain adding said functionality.
